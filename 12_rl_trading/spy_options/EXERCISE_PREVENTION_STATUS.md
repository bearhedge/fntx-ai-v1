# Exercise Prevention System - Implementation Status

## Phase 1: Terminal UI Fix ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Reverted feature_engine.py to 8 features**
   - Model expects 8 features but was receiving 12, causing crash
   - Terminal UI should now work properly
   - Moneyness is still calculated internally for auto-close logic

2. **Added feature compatibility method**
   - `get_exercise_risk_metrics()` provides moneyness/hours_to_expiry
   - Auto-close mechanism at 3:55 PM ET remains functional
   - Exercise logger still tracks positions for future training

### Files Modified:
- `/data_pipeline/feature_engine.py` - Reverted to 8 features with compatibility layer
- `/feature_mode_config.py` - NEW: Configuration for switching between feature modes

## Phase 2: FlexQuery Date Issue ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IBKR CONFIG

### The Problem:
- FlexQuery showing July 17 data instead of July 18 (current day)
- 620P from July 16 appearing (expired, not exercised)
- 628C exercise from July 18 not showing

### Solution Required:
The date range is configured in the IBKR FlexQuery template, not in code.
You need to:
1. Log into IBKR Account Management
2. Go to Reports > Flex Queries
3. Edit your FlexQuery template
4. Change date range to "Today" or "Last 2 Days" instead of fixed dates
5. Save and note the new Query ID

## Phase 3: Future 12-Feature Model üîÑ PLANNED

### Implementation Path:
1. **Collect exercise data** (exercise_logger.py is ready)
2. **Export training data** with `python export_training_data.py`
3. **Retrain model** with `python retrain_with_exercises.py`
4. **Switch to 12-feature mode**:
   ```bash
   export SPY_FEATURE_MODE=exercise_aware_12
   # Or
   python feature_mode_config.py --set exercise_aware_12
   ```

### New Features (Currently Calculated but Not Used):
- **Feature 8**: Moneyness (exercise risk)
- **Feature 9**: Hours to expiry  
- **Feature 10**: Intraday momentum
- **Feature 11**: VIX trajectory

## Current System Capabilities:

### ‚úÖ Working Now:
- Terminal UI (with 8 features)
- Exercise detection in XML parsing
- Auto-close at 3:55 PM ET for risky positions
- Exercise event logging for training
- Position tracking with exercise history

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention:
- FlexQuery date range (IBKR config change)
- Model retraining with 12 features

### üîÑ Ready for Future:
- Exercise-aware training data export
- Feature mode switching system
- Retraining scripts

## Quick Test:
```bash
# Run terminal UI (should work now)
cd /home/info/fntx-ai-v1/12_rl_trading/spy_options
python run_terminal_ui.py --mock

# Check feature mode
python feature_mode_config.py --status

# When ready, export training data
python export_training_data.py
```

## Note on 628C Exercise:
Your 628C was exercised because SPY closed at 628.04 on July 18. Once the FlexQuery date range is fixed, this should appear in the exercise detection. The system is now ready to prevent future exercises through:
1. Moneyness monitoring
2. Auto-close at 3:55 PM ET
3. RL model penalties for exercise events
