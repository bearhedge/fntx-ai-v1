# Gemini Agent Changelog

This document tracks all noteworthy actions performed by the Gemini agent to the `fntx-ai-v1` repository.

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-22 18:45:00
**Action:** System Diagnosis & Historical Summary
**Target:** The ALM Automation Pipeline (`alm_automation.py`, `build_alm_data_append.py`, `alm_reporting` schema)
**Intent:** To provide a complete summary of the debugging process so far, to establish a clear baseline for all future actions.

**Summary of Events:**

The initial goal was to automate the ALM narrative generation by building a pipeline around the existing, functional `calculation_engine.py`.

1.  **Initial Fixes:** The orchestrator script, `alm_automation.py`, was initially broken. It was modified to correctly call the `generate_daily_narrative` function from the calculation engine instead of a non-existent class. The `build_alm_data_append.py` script was created to handle incremental data loads, and all required database tables (`import_history`, `processing_status`, etc.) were successfully created.

2.  **Test 1 & Failure:** The first end-to-end backfill test was run.
    *   **Error:** The test failed immediately with a SQL error: `column "imported_at" of relation "import_history" does not exist`.
    *   **Fix:** The `alm_automation.py` script was corrected to use the proper column names (`completed_at`) in its `INSERT` statement, aligning it with the database schema.

3.  **Test 2 & Failure (Silent):** The backfill test was re-run.
    *   **Error:** The script completed without crashing, but a manual check of the `daily_summary` table showed that no new row for `2025-07-21` had been created. The failure was silent.
    *   **Fix:** The `build_alm_data_append.py` script was identified as the cause. It was missing the logic to calculate and insert the daily summary data. This logic was added, using an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statement to be robust.

4.  **Test 3 & Failure (Silent):** The backfill test was run a third time with the supposedly fixed script.
    *   **Error:** The result was identical to Test 2. The script completed without error, but the `daily_summary` table remains unchanged. No new row for `2025-07-21` was added.

**Current Status & Hypothesis:**

We are currently stuck at the failure from Test 3. The automation pipeline runs without crashing but fails to produce the final, correct output (a new row in the `daily_summary` table).

My current hypothesis is that the `build_alm_data_append.py` script is not finding any events for the target date (`2025-07-21`) when it parses the Month-to-Date XML file. If it finds no events for that specific day, its summary logic is never triggered, and no new row is inserted.

**Proposed Next Step:**

To confirm this hypothesis, the next logical action is to add detailed, granular logging to the `build_alm_data_append.py` script. This logging will trace the exact data flow:
*   Which XML files are being parsed.
*   The date range of events found within the files.
*   The number of events processed for the target date.
*   The content of the final summary data (if any) that is calculated.

This will give us the necessary visibility to diagnose the root cause of the silent failure.
