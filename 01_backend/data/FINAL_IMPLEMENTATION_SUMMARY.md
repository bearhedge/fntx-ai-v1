# Final Implementation: Non-Adjusted Prices + Volume Filtering

## Problem Solved
- **Adjusted vs Non-Adjusted**: Options trade at non-adjusted prices
- **Yahoo provides both**: Use `auto_adjust=False` for correct prices
- **Price difference**: $384.37 (non-adjusted) vs $371.60 (adjusted) = $12.77
- **ATM correction**: $384 (correct) vs $372 (wrong)

## Implementation

### 1. Non-Adjusted Prices (Simplified)
```python
# No need for AlphaVantage - Yahoo Finance has this built-in
data = spy.history(start=date, end=end_date, auto_adjust=False)
```

### 2. Volume Filtering
```python
min_volume_bars = 60  # 60 bars × 5 min = 5 hours
# Only keep contracts with substantial trading activity
```

### 3. Combined Effect
- **Correct ATM**: $384 based on non-adjusted price
- **Strike selection**: Smart selector will focus around $384
- **Volume filter**: Keep only liquid contracts (60+ bars)
- **Expected result**: 5-10 contracts per side

## Key Benefits

1. **Price Accuracy**: Using actual trading prices, not adjusted
2. **Liquidity Focus**: 60-bar threshold ensures meaningful data
3. **Simplicity**: No external API dependencies (AlphaVantage)
4. **Robustness**: Works regardless of dividend adjustments

## Testing

### Before (Wrong ATM $372)
- Downloaded strikes: $358-$378
- Missing critical strikes: $379-$394

### After (Correct ATM $384)
- Will download strikes: ~$374-$394
- Centered on actual trading activity
- Volume filtered for quality
