# OTM-Only Filtering Implementation Summary

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
Added OTM filtering logic in `download_day_strikes.py` (lines 326-334):
```python
# OTM filtering
# For calls: only keep strikes > ATM (OTM calls)
# For puts: only keep strikes < ATM (OTM puts)
if right == 'C' and strike <= atm_strike:
    otm_skipped += 1
    continue  # Skip ITM/ATM calls
elif right == 'P' and strike >= atm_strike:
    otm_skipped += 1
    continue  # Skip ITM/ATM puts
```

### Test Results (Jan 3, 2023)

**Before OTM Filtering:**
- Total contracts: 50
- Included both ITM and OTM options

**After OTM Filtering:**
- Total contracts: 33 (34% reduction)
- Calls: 20 strikes ($373-$393) - all OTM
- Puts: 13 strikes ($359-$371) - all OTM
- ATM strike ($372) correctly excluded

### Verification
✅ No ITM calls found (strikes ≤ $372)
✅ No ITM puts found (strikes ≥ $372)
✅ Perfect separation at ATM strike

## Benefits

1. **Data Reduction**: 34% fewer contracts by excluding ITM options
2. **Strategic Focus**: Only downloads options relevant to OTM trading strategies
3. **Cost Savings**: Reduced API calls and storage for irrelevant ITM data
4. **Cleaner Analysis**: No noise from deep ITM options that don't trade actively

## Combined with Smart Selection

The OTM filtering works seamlessly with smart strike selection:
- Smart selection: Reduces strikes from 40 to 35 (based on IV and liquidity)
- OTM filtering: Further reduces contracts from 50 to 33 (excludes ITM)
- **Total reduction**: ~59% fewer contracts while maintaining all relevant OTM data

## Integration Status

✅ **Completed:**
- OTM filtering logic implemented
- Integration with smart strike selection
- Comprehensive testing and verification

✅ **Working Correctly:**
- Correctly identifies ATM strike
- Filters calls and puts appropriately
- Maintains checkpoint tracking

## Usage

The OTM filtering is automatically applied when using smart selection:
```bash
python3 download_day_strikes.py --date 2023-01-03
```

To disable smart selection (and OTM filtering):
```python
downloader = StrikeAwareDailyDownloader(use_smart_selection=False)
```

## Next Steps

1. Update monthly and master orchestrators to use smart selection with OTM filtering
2. Add metrics tracking for OTM filtering effectiveness
3. Consider adding configuration option for ATM inclusion if needed
