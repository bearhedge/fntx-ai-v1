# Trading Guardrail Implementation

## Date: 2025-07-31

## Overview
Implemented a trading guardrail system in the Market Timer panel that enforces a time delay between market open and the first trade. This helps ensure sufficient market information has been gathered before making trading decisions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Text Update
- Changed "Next 3 Critical Events" to "Upcoming Events" as requested

### 2. Trading Guardrail System

#### Visual Design
The guardrail appears on the right side of the Market Timer panel and displays:
```
TRADING GUARDRAIL

[████████░░░░░░] 53%
1.5h mode • 48m elapsed

⏱️ 42m until trading
```

When trading is allowed:
```
TRADING GUARDRAIL

[████████████████████] 100%
1.5h mode • 92m elapsed

✅ Trading allowed
```

#### Features
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of time elapsed since market open
- **Percentage Display**: Shows completion percentage
- **Time Settings**: Three configurable settings:
  - 1.5 hours (90 minutes)
  - 3.0 hours (180 minutes)
  - 4.5 hours (270 minutes)
- **Color Coding**:
  - Red progress bar and text when trading is restricted
  - Green progress bar and text when trading is allowed
- **Time Information**: Shows elapsed time and remaining time until trading

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### New Methods Added to `MarketTimerPanel`:

1. **`create_guardrail_display()`**
   - Creates the visual progress bar display
   - Calculates percentage complete
   - Formats time remaining/allowed message

2. **`should_allow_trading_guardrail()`**
   - Checks if enough time has passed since market open
   - Returns True/False based on current guardrail setting

3. **`cycle_guardrail_setting()`**
   - Allows cycling through the three time settings
   - Returns the new setting value

#### Integration with Existing System
- The guardrail works alongside existing event-based restrictions
- Trading is only allowed when BOTH conditions are met:
  1. No event blackout periods (FOMC, NFP, etc.)
  2. Guardrail time threshold has been reached
- Updated `should_block_trading()` to check both conditions

### 4. Layout Changes
- Modified the panel to use a two-column layout:
  - Left column (60%): Upcoming events list
  - Right column (40%): Trading guardrail display
- Maintains clean visual separation between components

## Benefits

1. **Enforced Discipline**: Prevents emotional early trades by enforcing a waiting period
2. **Market Information**: Allows sufficient time for market patterns to develop
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of when trading will be allowed
4. **Flexibility**: Three time settings accommodate different trading strategies
5. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing event-based restrictions

## Usage

The guardrail is automatically active when the market is open. Users can:
- View the current progress and time remaining
- See when trading will be allowed
- (Future enhancement) Press a key to cycle through time settings

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify:
- Guardrail calculations at different times
- Setting cycling functionality
- Integration with existing trading restrictions
- Visual display formatting

## Future Enhancements

1. Add keyboard shortcut to cycle guardrail settings
2. Save user preference for guardrail setting
3. Add sound/notification when guardrail expires
4. Track effectiveness metrics (trades made after guardrail vs before)
5. Add override capability for emergency situations (with logging)
