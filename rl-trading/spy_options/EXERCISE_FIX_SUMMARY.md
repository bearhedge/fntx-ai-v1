# Exercise Detection Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues:
1. **3-second database error** - Commented out lines 86-93 in reasoning_panel.py that were querying the database every 3 seconds
2. **F key instructions** - Updated RLHF panel to show "Type 'F' + Enter" instead of "Press [F]"
3. **List import error** - Added List to imports in dashboard.py line 8

## IBKR Exercise Detection Added:
The system now parses two new FlexQuery sections:
- "Option Exercises, Assignments and Expirations"
- "Pending Exercises"

## Code Flow:
1. **run_terminal_ui.py** (lines 379-419):
   - Parses exercises from IBKR FlexQuery XML
   - Stores in `ibkr_exercises` list with format: {'symbol': '628C', 'date': '2025-01-17', 'type': 'Exercise/Assignment/Pending'}
   - Passes to dashboard via `dashboard.set_ibkr_exercises(ibkr_exercises)`

2. **dashboard.py**:
   - Stores exercises in `self.ibkr_exercises` (line 97)
   - Passes to reasoning panel on each update (line 272): `self.reasoning_panel.set_ibkr_exercises(self.ibkr_exercises)`

3. **reasoning_panel.py**:
   - Stores exercises (line 576)
   - Displays in UI via `_create_ibkr_exercise_section()` (lines 663-714)
   - Shows different alerts:
     - Red blinking "⚠️ PENDING" for pending exercises
     - Green "✅ EXERCISED" for completed exercises
     - Special alert if 628C is found

## To Run:
```bash
cd /home/info/fntx-ai-v1/12_rl_trading/spy_options
source venv/bin/activate
python run_terminal_ui.py --local-theta --enable-rl
```

## Expected Behavior:
- No more "Error fetching positions" every 3 seconds
- F key instructions are clear
- If 628C was exercised (SPY closed at 628.04 > 628.00 strike), it will show:
  - In the exercise section with alert
  - Red border if pending
  - Green border if exercised

## Manual Check:
To check exercises without running full UI, check IBKR directly or run the check_exercises.py script.
