# TRUE STREAMING IMPLEMENTATION

## Summary

Successfully implemented TRUE streaming for Theta Terminal using the official Theta Data Python client library. This is PURE STREAMING with NO REST POLLING.

## Key Components

### 1. Official Theta Data Client
- Found at: `/home/info/fntx-ai-v1/11_venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/thetadata`
- Uses port 11000 (MDDS - Market Data Distribution Service) for Python streaming
- NOT port 25520 (WebSocket) which is for cloud API only

### 2. Updated Implementation
- File: `streaming_theta_connector.py`
- Uses `ThetaClient` from official `thetadata` package
- Implements true streaming via `connect_stream()` method
- NO fallback to REST polling - pure streaming only

### 3. Key Features
- Real-time option quote streaming
- Real-time option trade streaming  
- Yahoo Finance integration for real-time SPY price (compensates for delayed stock data)
- Proper straddle format display

### 4. Streaming Protocol
```python
# Initialize client
client = ThetaClient(
    username="info@bearhedge.com",
    passwd="25592266",
    launch=False,  # Use existing terminal
    streaming_port=11000  # MDDS port for Python
)

# Connect streaming with callback
stream_thread = client.connect_stream(callback_function)

# Subscribe to options
client.req_quote_stream_opt(root="SPY", exp=date, strike=strike, right=right)
client.req_trade_stream_opt(root="SPY", exp=date, strike=strike, right=right)
```

### 5. Important Notes
- Theta Data client doesn't support stock streaming (only options)
- Use Yahoo Finance for real-time SPY price
- Streaming updates are less frequent when market is closed
- The `_process_bulk_quote` method was added to handle bulk responses

## Testing

Run during market hours for best results:
```bash
/home/info/fntx-ai-v1/11_venv/bin/python3 test_theta_streaming.py
```

## Architecture
```
Theta Terminal (port 11000) --> ThetaClient --> Stream Handler --> Market Data Cache
                                                                          |
Yahoo Finance API -------------------------------------------------> Real-time SPY Price
```

This is TRUE STREAMING - no polling, no REST API fallbacks!
