# Cash Flow Adjustments Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to properly handle deposits and withdrawals in the ALM reporting system, particularly for NAV adjustments and daily return calculations.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Cash Transaction Timestamps (build_alm_data_append.py)
- **Deposits**: Set to 8:00 AM ET (before market open at 9:30 AM)
- **Withdrawals**: Set to 4:00 PM ET (at market close)
- **Rationale**: IBKR doesn't provide timestamps for cash transactions, so we use logical assumptions

### 2. Daily Narrative NAV Display (calculation_engine_v1.py)
Added logic to check for deposits/withdrawals and adjust NAV display:

```python
# Check for deposits before market open (9:30 AM ET)
if deposits_before_open > 0:
    print(f"   Original NAV: **{format_hdk(opening_nav)}**")
    print(f"   Deposit before market open: **+{format_hdk(deposits_before_open)}**")
    adjusted_opening_nav = opening_nav + deposits_before_open
    print(f"   Adjusted NAV at market open: **{format_hdk(adjusted_opening_nav)}**")
```

### 3. Daily Return Calculation (calculation_engine_v1.py)
Modified return calculation to use adjusted NAV when applicable:

```python
if deposits_before_open > 0:
    # Use adjusted opening NAV for return calculation
    nav_change = closing_nav - adjusted_opening_nav - withdrawals_after_close
    nav_change_pct = (nav_change / adjusted_opening_nav * 100)
else:
    # Standard calculation when no early deposits
    nav_change = closing_nav - opening_nav - net_cash_flow
    nav_change_pct = (nav_change / opening_nav * 100)
```

## Example Output

### With Deposit Before Market Open:
```
**Opening Position**
   Original NAV: **775,000.00 HKD**
   Deposit before market open: **+50,000.00 HKD**
   Adjusted NAV at market open: **825,000.00 HKD**

**End of Day P&L:**
   Closing NAV: **779,500.00 HKD**
   Daily Return: **-5.52%**  (calculated using adjusted NAV)
```

### Without Early Deposits:
```
**Opening Position**
   NAV at market open: **850,000.00 HKD**

**End of Day P&L:**
   Closing NAV: **854,000.00 HKD**
   Daily Return: **+0.47%**  (standard calculation)
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Accurate Performance Measurement**: Daily returns now reflect actual trading performance, not distorted by cash flows
2. **Transparency**: Users can see both original and adjusted NAV values
3. **Logical Timing**: Deposits assumed before market open, withdrawals at close
4. **Systematic Approach**: No more hardcoded date-specific logic

## Testing
- Created test_cash_flow_changes.py to verify calculations
- Tested various scenarios: deposits, withdrawals, no cash flows
- Confirmed daily return uses adjusted NAV only when deposits occur before market open

## Files Modified
1. `/home/info/fntx-ai-v1/backend/alm/build_alm_data_append.py` - Lines 352-357
2. `/home/info/fntx-ai-v1/backend/alm/calculation_engine_v1.py` - Lines 685-719, 993-1002

## Next Steps
- Run full ALM report generation to verify all days calculate correctly
- Monitor for any edge cases or unusual scenarios
- Consider adding withdrawal fee handling if needed
