# GCP Cost Optimization Plan
**Emergency Cost Reduction for FNTX Project**

## Current Situation Analysis

### Critical Metrics
- **Credits Remaining**: HKD 9,600 (~$1,225)
- **Current Monthly Burn**: HKD 3,000 (~$385)
- **Time Until Depletion**: 3.2 months
- **Target**: Extend to 17+ months

### Current Infrastructure Costs
```
Component                Current Cost    Optimized Cost
CPU VM (large)          HKD 1,800/mo   HKD 234/mo  
GPU VM (stopped)        HKD 400/mo     HKD 0/mo
Storage (1TB+)          HKD 600/mo     HKD 312/mo
Network/Other           HKD 200/mo     HKD 20/mo
TOTAL                   HKD 3,000/mo   HKD 566/mo
```

## Recommended New Architecture

### VM Configuration
```yaml
Instance Type: e2-medium
vCPUs: 2
RAM: 4 GB
Region: us-central1-a (cheapest)
Storage: 500GB Standard Persistent Disk
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
```

### Monthly Cost Breakdown
```
e2-medium (730 hours):    HKD 234 ($30)
Storage (500GB std):      HKD 312 ($40)
Network (minimal):        HKD 20  ($2.50)
TOTAL:                    HKD 566 ($72.50)

SAVINGS: 82% reduction
```

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Document everything** ✅ (completed)
2. **Create backup** of all project files
3. **Stop GPU VM completely** (not just instance)
4. **Prepare new VM configuration**

### Phase 2: VM Migration (Next 2-3 hours)
1. **Create new e2-medium VM** in us-central1-a
2. **Transfer project files** using setup guide
3. **Test all functionality** before deleting old VM
4. **Verify cost reduction**

### Phase 3: Monitoring Setup (Same day)
1. **Set billing alerts** at HKD 600/month threshold
2. **Configure daily cost monitoring**
3. **Set up weekly backup automation**

## Detailed Cost Comparison

### Storage Optimization
```
Current: Multiple disks, 1TB+ total = HKD 600/month
Optimized: Single 500GB disk = HKD 312/month
Reasoning: 100GB historical data + 400GB headroom
```

### Compute Optimization
```
Current: Large instance 24/7 = HKD 1,800/month
Optimized: e2-medium on-demand = HKD 234/month
Reasoning: Sufficient for development, stop when not needed
```

### Regional Optimization
```
Current: asia-east1 (Taiwan) = Premium pricing
Optimized: us-central1 (Iowa) = Standard pricing
Savings: ~30% on all compute costs
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Safety
- **Complete backup** before any changes
- **Keep old VM running** until new one confirmed working
- **Test restoration** process before deletion

### Functionality Preservation
- **All ASCII art demos** must work
- **Blockchain integration** must function
- **Python environment** must be complete

### Cost Control
- **Billing alerts** at 50%, 90%, 100% of budget
- **Weekly cost reviews** to catch anomalies
- **Emergency shutdown** procedures if costs spike

## Timeline and Actions

### Day 1 (Today)
- [x] Create documentation ✅
- [ ] Create setup guide ✅
- [ ] Test backup/restore process
- [ ] Create new VM
- [ ] Begin migration

### Day 2
- [ ] Complete migration testing
- [ ] Delete old expensive resources
- [ ] Configure monitoring
- [ ] Verify cost reduction

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor daily costs
- [ ] Fine-tune resource usage
- [ ] Optimize storage further if needed

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- All FNTX blockchain demos working
- ASCII art displaying correctly
- Development environment functional
- No performance degradation for core tasks

### Financial Success
- Monthly costs below HKD 600
- Credits lasting 17+ months
- No unexpected cost spikes
- Stable, predictable billing

## Emergency Procedures

### If Costs Spike Above HKD 20/day
1. **Immediate**: Stop all non-essential services
2. **Investigate**: Check billing dashboard for root cause
3. **Contact**: Alert primary contact immediately
4. **Document**: Log all findings for future prevention

### If Migration Fails
1. **Rollback**: Keep old VM active
2. **Debug**: Systematic testing of new setup
3. **Iterate**: Fix issues one by one
4. **Verify**: Complete functionality before retry

### If Credits Run Low
1. **Priority**: Core trading system preservation
2. **Backup**: Download all critical data
3. **Alternative**: Prepare local development setup
4. **Timeline**: Plan transition to alternative hosting
