    Notes/Legal Notes
Notes
        1.      Stock exchange transactions generally settle on the trade date plus one business or two business days (T+1 or T+2). Options, futures and US open-end mutual fund transactions also settle on trade date plus one
                business day. Some exchanges and other transaction types may have longer or shorter settlement periods. Ending settled cash reflects the cash that has actually settled.
        2.      Initial and maintenance margin requirements are available within the Account Window of the Trader Workstation or the Margin Report available in Account Management.
        3.      Quantities preceded by a "-" sign indicate sell transactions. Other transactions are purchases.
        4.      IB acts as agent in executing the fractional share portion of your order. In certain circumstances, IB routes the fractional portion of your order to an affiliate, which may execute the fractional portion of the order as
                principal. In such circumstances, this is indicated by the codes associated with the trade. If an IB affiliate acts as principal in executing any fractional share portion of your order, the order will be executed at the price
                displayed for the opposite side of the NBBO from your order (the offer if you are buying and the bid if you are selling) at the time of execution. If an IB affiliate is acting as riskless principal in connection with filling the
                fractional share portion of your order, the affiliate will execute the fractional share portion of your order at the price it receives for the execution of the whole share.
        5.      In case of partial executions, commissions are charged on the total quantity executed on the original order. The commission is displayed on the first partial execution only.
        6.      Trade execution times are displayed in United States Eastern Time.
        7.      Borrow Fee Rate represents the cost to borrow stock expressed in percent per annum. It is applied to the collateral value on the stock borrow contract and is separate from any interest earned on credit cash balances.
                Similarly, Loan Fee Rate represents the benefit to lend stock. A positive rate indicates a cost to the borrower/benefit to the lender and a negative rate indicates a benefit to the borrower/cost to the lender. In general, the
                fee rates for hard-to-borrow stocks are higher than for normal availability stocks.
        8.      Interest Rate on Customer Collateral represents the interest paid on the collateral posted to the customer's account and received from lending stock. A positive rate indicates a benefit to the lender.
        9.      The closing prices on this Activity Statement are indicative and may come from third-party sources. Interactive Brokers does not warrant the accuracy of the prices provided by third-party sources. Due to time zone
                differences, certain non-US mutual funds may deliver closing prices after the Activity Statement has been produced and the closing prices for such funds will reflect the previous day's price.

Mutual Fund Notes
    1.      All purchase and sales of mutual funds are calculated against the published NAV (Net Asset Value) of the underlying fund and is displayed on this confirmation as the "C. Price" (Closing Price). Due to any fees charged
            by a fund and/or any share rounding, the net price you pay may vary from the published NAV and is shown on this confirmation as the "T. Price" (Trade Price).
Fixed Income Notes
    1.      Call features for bonds or preferred stocks may affect the yield. For zero coupon, compound interest and multiplier securities, there are no periodic payments and securities may be callable below maturity value without
            notice to holder unless registered. For asset-backed securities, the actual yield may vary depending on the speed at which the underlying note is pre-paid. For additional information regarding bond yield, please contact
            the IB Help Desk at: ibkr.com/help. If this debt security is unrated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, it may pose a high risk of default. You should consult an independent advisor to determine
            whether unrated bonds are appropriate for your portfolio in light of your goals and your financial circumstances. Fees charged by bond trading centers are included in the cost of bond transactions.
