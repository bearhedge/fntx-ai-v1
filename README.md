## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Python 3.8+
- Interactive Brokers Gateway (for live trading)
- VNC Viewer (for accessing IB Gateway desktop)

### VNC Trading Desktop Access
Connect to the trading desktop to manage IB Gateway:
- **Address**: `35.194.231.94:5901`
- **Password**: `fntx2024`
- [Detailed VNC Setup Guide](docs/VNC_TRADING_SETUP.md)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fntx-ai-v10
   npm install
   pip install -r agents/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment setup**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or use the convenience script
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   - Main Interface: http://localhost:8080
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Architecture
