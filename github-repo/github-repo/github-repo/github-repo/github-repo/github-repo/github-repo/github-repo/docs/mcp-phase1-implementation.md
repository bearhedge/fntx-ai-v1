## Usage Examples

### Storing a Memory
```python
async with mcp.agent_context("StrategicPlannerAgent", session_id) as ctx:
    memory_id = await ctx.store_memory(MemorySlice(
        memory_type=MemoryType.STRATEGIC_PLANNING,
        content={"strategy": "SPY_PUT_SELLING", "confidence": 0.85},
        importance=MemoryImportance.HIGH
    ))
```

### Semantic Search
```python
similar_conditions = await ctx.semantic_search(
    "High volatility market with SPY near support",
    scope="session"
)
```

### Context Sharing
```python
await ctx.share_context(
    to_agents=["ExecutorAgent", "RiskManagerAgent"],
    context={"critical_alert": "Market regime change detected"}
)
```

### Learning Submission
```python
await mcp.submit_reflection(agent_id, {
    "patterns": ["Morning trades show higher success"],
    "improvements": ["Increase position size in favorable conditions"],
    "success_factors": ["Low VIX correlation with wins"]
})
```
