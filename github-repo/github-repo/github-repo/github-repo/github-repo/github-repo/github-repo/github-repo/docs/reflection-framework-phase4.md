   - Records and analyzes trade outcomes
   - Calculates performance metrics
   - Generates performance alerts
   - Maintains equity curve and risk metrics

2. **Learning Engine** (`learning_engine.py`)
   - Analyzes trading patterns
   - Generates actionable insights
   - Creates strategy adjustments
   - Validates learning effectiveness

3. **Cross-Agent Learning Hub** (`cross_agent_learning.py`)
   - Facilitates knowledge sharing between agents
   - Tracks adoption of shared learnings
   - Synthesizes multi-agent insights
   - Measures collaborative improvement

4. **Reflection Manager** (`reflection_manager.py`)
   - Orchestrates the entire reflection process
   - Manages reflection cycles

# Create adjustment
adjustment = StrategyAdjustment(
    strategy_name="SPY_PUT_SELL",
    adjustment_type="risk_parameters",
    parameter_changes={
        'stop_loss_multiplier': {'old': 3.0, 'new': 3.5}
    },
    reasoning=["Stops too tight in volatile conditions"],
    expected_impact={'win_rate': 0.05}
)

# Auto-approve if criteria met
if should_auto_approve(adjustment):
    await implement_adjustment(adjustment)
```

### 4. Performance Validation
```python
