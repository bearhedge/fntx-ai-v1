  Based on IBKR's response and our testing:                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                       
  1. OAuth vs Gateway Relationship:

  Current: OAuth → Direct to API → ❌ "iserver not authenticated"

  1. Start Client Portal Gateway (required for trading bridge)                                  
  2. Use OAuth to authenticate through the gateway                                              
  3. Execute ARM $145 Call order                
  4. Verify order placement                                                
                                                                           
  The key realization: OAuth handles authentication beautifully, but IBKR designed it so actual trading must go through their gateway for                                                        
  security. This prevents unauthorized trading even if OAuth credentials are compromised.
