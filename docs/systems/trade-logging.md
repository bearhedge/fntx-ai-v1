# Automated Trade Logging System

This system runs 24/7 to automatically capture all trades executed through IBKR with **zero manual entry**.

## System Architecture

1. **Database** (PostgreSQL)
   - Schema: `trading`
   - Tables: `trades`, `executions`, `order_links`
   - Views: `performance_metrics`, `daily_performance`, `strike_analysis`, etc.
   - Blockchain preparation fields included

2. **Trade Logger Service** (`ibkr_trade_logger.py`)
   - Connects to IBKR Gateway on port 4001
   - Listens for trade events automatically
   - Logs entries, exits, commissions, P&L
   - Broadcasts updates via WebSocket

3. **Trade API** (`trade_api.py`)
   - Runs on port 8001
   - Endpoints:
     - `/api/trades/history` - Trade history
     - `/api/trades/performance` - Performance metrics
     - `/api/trades/active` - Open positions
     - `/api/trades/analytics` - Trade analytics

4. **Frontend** (History Tab)
   - Shows all trades automatically
   - Real-time updates
   - P&L tracking
   - No manual entry required

## Current Status

✅ Database created with sample trades
✅ Trade API running on port 8001
✅ Frontend updated to display trades
✅ 24/7 service architecture ready

## To Complete Setup

1. **Install as systemd service** (for 24/7 operation):
```bash
sudo cp /home/info/fntx-ai-v1/backend/services/fntx-trade-logger.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable fntx-trade-logger
sudo systemctl start fntx-trade-logger
```

2. **Check service status**:
```bash
sudo systemctl status fntx-trade-logger
tail -f /home/info/fntx-ai-v1/backend/trade_logger.log
```

## How It Works

1. When you execute trades through IBKR, the trade logger automatically:
   - Captures order submissions
   - Records executions with exact prices
   - Tracks commissions
   - Detects position closures
   - Calculates P&L including fees

2. All data flows to PostgreSQL automatically

3. The History tab shows all trades with:
   - Entry/exit times and prices
   - P&L (color coded)
   - Exit reasons (expired, stopped out, etc.)
   - Time active for open positions

4. Analytics views provide:
   - Daily performance
   - Strike analysis
   - Time of day analysis
   - Risk metrics

## Blockchain Preparation

The schema includes fields for blockchain integration:
- `blockchain_hash` - For immutable record hash
- `blockchain_tx_id` - Transaction ID when written to chain
- `blockchain_status` - Pending/confirmed status

## No Manual Entry

This system is fully automated. You never need to:
- Log trades manually
- Calculate P&L
- Track positions
- Update records

Everything is captured automatically from IBKR in real-time.

## Data Analysis

Use the analytics views to optimize your trading:
```sql
-- Daily performance
SELECT * FROM trading.daily_performance;

-- Strike analysis
SELECT * FROM trading.strike_analysis;

-- Time analysis
SELECT * FROM trading.time_analysis;
```

## API is Running

The Trade API is currently running on port 8001. You can test it:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/trades/history
```

## SPY Data Download Status

The 4-year SPY options data download is still running (~65% complete).
